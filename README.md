How to use the program:
Upon running the program, at the Menu screen, type in the year that you want the program to analyse. The earliest year is 2017 and latest year is 2030. Currently, the available years are 2017 and 2018. The program will check whether the entered year exists as a folder, then produces the results. You will have the option to download the results as a .csv file. The .csv file downloaded will be named WakaAmaRanking{year}, where {year} is the year that you selected.
